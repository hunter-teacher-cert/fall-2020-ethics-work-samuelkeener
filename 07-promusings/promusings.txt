Ranked shortlist of topics:
#1 - The lake of toxic sludge in Baotou 
Just about the most eye opening thing I've read this week
More people oughta know

#2 - power consumption in data centers
Us humans, we are so arrogant aren't we.

#3 - The digital divide between schools and communities
Obviously an important thing to all of us in particular.
